  This service is the same as MS_FOLDERS_GET_PATH with the difference that this service
  allocates the needed space for the buffer. It uses miranda's memory functions for that and you need
  to use those to free the resulting buffer.
  Should return 0 on success, or nonzero otherwise. Currently it only returns 0.
