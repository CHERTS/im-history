             that isn't on the list (or is unknown in some way)

    Returns: 0 on success, [nonzero] on failure
    Notes  : wParam: NULL(0) can be used to see if an unknown contact should be
             ignored or not - you can't SET unknown contact's ignore types, this
             is to stop a plugin allowing certain functions (I guess)
